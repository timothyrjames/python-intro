# Arithmetic in Python

print(100 - 23 + 7 - 4)


# If you want to change the order of operations, you can enclose parts of the 
# calculation in parentheses. 

print(100 - (23 + 7) - 4)


# We can multiply using an asterisk.

print(33.2 * 12.5)


# Different arithmetic operations can be mixed.
# Note that multiplication occurs before addition & subtraction, so ordering
# matters.

print(2 * 10 - 4 + 3 * 6)


# Division uses a forward slash.

print(40 / 3)


# If we want to use integer division (also called floor division), we use a
# double forward slash.

print(40 // 3)

print(50 / 11)
print(50 // 11)
